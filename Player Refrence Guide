1. Introduction to The Stardust Spectrum
How to play
The Stardust Spectrum is a D20-based tabletop RPG system that combines resource management, tactical combat, and immersive storytelling. Players need only a single 20-sided die to engage in all core mechanics, including attacks, skill checks, and saving throws. The game utilizes hexagonal combat maps to emphasize positioning and strategy, where Spectrum zones dynamically affect gameplay. While offering familiar RPG features like leveling, equipment upgrades, and dice rolls, the SSRPG stands out with its vibrant stat pools, environmental interactions, and innovative Clash system for high-stakes encounters. This blend ensures that every session feels both approachable and refreshingly unique.
Core Themes
    • Adaptability and Strategy: Emphasizing resource management and tactical decision-making.
    • Environmental Interaction: Leveraging Spectrum zones for survival and dominance.
    • Creativity in Gameplay: Encouraging players to build and strategize freely.

2. Game Mechanics
Character Creation
    1. Choose a Character Type: Determines the doubled core stat (Vigor, Stamina, or Mana).
        ◦ Power Type: Boosts melee damage and fortitude.
        ◦ Speed Type: Enhances mobility and ranged weapon range.
        ◦ Magic Type: Amplifies spellcasting and spell effects/effectiveness.
    2. Allocate Core Stats (Vibrant Stats): Vigor, Stamina, Mana, and Hope. These stats are considered pool and will move up and down to their base number.
        ◦ Starting Points: Allocate 3 points among stats. All stats start at 1.
    3. Select Starting Skills and Abilities: Equip Level 1 options tailored to the character’s type.
    4. Choose Equipment: Start with a Level 1 weapon and armor. Customize as you progress.
Core and Substats
    • Core Stats (Vibrant):
        ◦ Vigor: Governs melee actions and damage.
        ◦ Stamina: Influences movement, speed and ranged actions.
        ◦ Mana: Governs spellcasting and intelligence checks.
        ◦ Hope: It regenerates whenever a player rolls a natural 1 or 20 and fully refreshes at the end of every scene. Players can expend points in this pool to add to their roll to hit rolls.
    • Substats (Vivid): Include Skills/Spells, Abilities, Proficiencies, Augmentations, and Armor. Each is upgraded independently.
Dice System
    1. Roll to Hit: Use 1d20 for attacks, adding core stat bonuses based on the type of roll.
    2. Roll States: Determine success levels:
        ◦ Fail (1–5), Mixed (6-15), Success (16–20), Critical Successes (21+).
    3. Saving Throws: Use Vigor, Stamina, or Mana for resistance rolls.
Combat Mechanics
    • Dynamic Pools: Spend Vigor, Stamina or Mana during turns. Regenerate fully at turn start.
    • Clash System: Engage in high-stakes duels with resource-dependent outcomes.
    • Spectrum Zones: Leverage environmental boosts for tactical advantages.

3. Spectrum Mechanics
Spectrum Zones and Effects
General: Spectrums will have a 1-5 level that determines the AoE and amount of points that can be drained from it before it goes dormant for the rest of the scene. 
    • Yellow Spectrum: Regenerates Hope points.
    • White Spectrum: Boosts Health and healing effects.
    • Red Spectrum: Increases Vigor for melee actions.
    • Blue Spectrum: Enhances Stamina, mobility, and ranged attacks.
    • Purple Spectrum: Amplifies Mana, AoE size, and spell potency.
    • Green Spectrum: Provides Prisms for leveling.
    • Black Spectrum: Drains all core stats, acting as a hazard.
    • Dormant Spectrum Zones: Once a spectrum zone is drained, the dormant zone produces a ‘grey’ AoE that absorbs the corresponding stats. Once it reaches its max in what it can absorb, the dormant zone becomes active again but starting at 1 and each turn increasing its range and effectiveness by 1 until it reaches the normal max level for the zone.
Tactical Implications
    • Resource Denial: Absorb Spectrums to prevent enemy use.
    • Overcapping: Temporarily exceed stat caps with Spectrum boosts.
    • Max Cap: Stats cannot exceed 10.
    • Team Strategy: Coordinate Spectrum usage for collective advantage.

4. Character Advancement
Leveling Systems
    • Core Stats: Upgrade with Vibrant Prisms including character level.
    • Substats: Enhance Skills/Spells, Abilities, and more using Vivid Prisms.
    • Health Scaling: Exponential growth from 20 (Level 1) to 240 (Level 5).
Prism Usage
    • Vibrant Prisms: Core Stats, Weapon level and Character Level.
    • Vivid Prisms: Substats and Weapon Stats.

5. Weapons and Equipment
Weapon Stats and Customization
    • Core Stats: Vigor, Stamina or Mana to determine weapon functionality.
    • Leveling Weapons: Use Vibrant Prisms for overall level and Vivid Prisms for stats. Parent level determines its stats cap. Must level the weapon to level 2 before stats can be leveled up.
    • Hybrid Weapons: Switch between melee and magical modes.
